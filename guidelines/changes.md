# Reaction Commerce Code of Conduct - Changes

**Change control process**

We're proud geeks, so we'll track changes to the Code of Conduct and associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will proposed via a pull request to the [Reaction Commerce documentationrepository on GitHub](http://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs). Changes will be reviewed by the conduct committee first, and then sent to the the Reaction core team, and then to the Reaction community for comment. We'll hold a comment period of at least one week, and then each group will vote on the change using its normal process (a board for the Reaction Commerce, a core dev vote for the core team). Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.

This only applies to material changes; changes that don't effect the intent (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.

A complete list of changes can always be found on GitHub; major changes and releases are summarized below.
