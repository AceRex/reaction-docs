## Faker

The [reaction-factories](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-factories) package supplies `Factory` and `faker` with additional methods for testing Reaction packages.

```
shopId = faker.reaction.shops.getShop()._id;
```

- faker.reaction.metaField
- faker.reaction.productVariant
- faker.reaction.cartItem
- faker.reaction.order
- faker.reaction.shops
- faker.reaction.users
