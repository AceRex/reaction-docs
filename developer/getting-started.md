# Getting Started with Reaction
Reaction is developed with the Meteor framework. Reaction also liberally uses NPM packages, and tooling.

Before getting started, here's some resources worth reviewing:
- [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/)
- [Meteor Docs](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/)
- [ES2015+ features](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/master/packages/ecmascript#supported-es2015-features)
- [Using NPM + Browserify](http://guide.meteor.com/build-tool.html#client-npm)
- [Less](http://guide.meteor.com/build-tool.html#less)

## Packages
A number of packages are included in the `reaction` local `packages` folder. In this documentation, these local packages are commonly referred to as "Core" packages.

Some of the "Core" packages:
- reaction-accounts
- reaction-analytics
- reaction-analytics-libs
- reaction-collections
- reaction-core
- reaction-core-theme
- reaction-default-theme
- reaction-email-templates
- reaction-sample-data
- reaction-schemas
- reaction-social
- reaction-shipping
- reaction-ui

These packages are also published to [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=reaction). Atmosphere is the Meteor package registry, and Reaction installs Meteor package dependencies from Atmosphere. These packages are referenced and linked throughout the documentation. To view a complete list, look at `.meteor/versions` and `.meteor/packages` in the Reaction root folder.

You can create or [use community packages](http://guide.meteor.com/build-tool.html#using-packages) to add customized functionality to Reaction.

## Roadmap
For a high level review our roadmap, take a look at our features page [Reaction Vision](https://reactioncommerce.com/features)

For grouping of development channels by feature see [GitHub project milestones](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/milestones)

Perhaps the best overall view, is our [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/reactioncommerce/reaction). This project board includes additional project progress for Reaction Commerce beyond just the Core.

## Issues
For development tasks/issues please use the [Reaction project issues of GItHub](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?state=open). We're keeping this as the central issue tracking for all [reactioncommerce:*](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/) packages.
