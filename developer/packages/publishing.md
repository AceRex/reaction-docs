# Publishing

Use the [meteor publish](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteorpublish) command line tool to publish a package to `Atmosphere`.

You will need to create a Meteor account at https://meteor.com

A new package (from the package root):

```
meteor publish â€”create
```

Or an update to an existing package:

```
meteor publish
```
