# Customizing Styles

## Customizing Themes
**To add or override custom styles:**

In **client/themes** you can create your own theme directory and `.less` files:

### Step 1: Create a theme folder

Create a folder called `my-custom-theme` in  `client/themes`.

### Step 2: Add your own CSS

In your new folder `my-custom-theme` create a file named `custom.less`. Add your styles there.

### Step 3: Happy theming
Add any number of LESS or CSS files to your theme folder to customize the current theme in use.

## Moving Forward

If you want a more control over the style of your shop, please see the [full theming guide](/developer/themes/theming.md) which will walk you through making a custom theme package.
