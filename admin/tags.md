# Tags and Navigation

Tags provide an easy way to classify and search for product items by group. This is what we refer to as a hashtag taxonomy.

Reaction features two types of tags: product tags and navigation tags. Product tags help customers find what they’re looking for, while navigation tags organize these keywords by category.

## Product Tags

To assign a tag to a product, go to the product detail page by clicking on the product. Tags will then be located below the images section.

To create a new tag, click on the “Add Tags” box, type in your tag, and hit enter to save. If the item is a t-shirt, for instance, you might want to tag it with relevant keywords, like short sleeve, cotton, crewneck, etc.

To delete a tag, click on the gray “x” icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-deletetag.png "Reaction Commerce delete tag")).

To rearrange the order of a tag, click on the three horizontal lines icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-movetag.png "Reaction Commerce move tags")), and simply drag and drop.

### Hashtag URLs

To create a product link, click on the flag icon for each tag. It'll generates a URL for your product relevant to that tag.

Hashtag URLs will allow you to gather key performance metrics on your products: social reach, how this item compares to other products in your store, location-based data, and much more. Better data will enable you to better market to your customers.

## Navigation Tags

To edit your shop's navigation tags, click on the “Add Tag” button in the top nav bar.

To create a new navigation tag, type your keyword into the empty “Add Tag” box and hit enter to save. Previously created tags may be autosuggested for you. Be sure your product tag corresponds with a navigation tag. Otherwise, your product page will be empty!

To rearrange navigation tags, click on the 3 horizontal lines icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-movetag.png "Reaction Commerce move tag")). Drag and drop the tags in whichever order you like.

When you're finished, click anywhere outside of the top nav bar, and you're done!
