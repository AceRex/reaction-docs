# Tags and Navigation

Tags provide an easy way to classify and search for product items by group. This is what we refer to as a hashtag taxonomy.

Reaction features two types of tags: product tags and navigation tags. Product tags help customers find what they’re looking for, while navigation tags organize these keywords by category.

## Product Tags

To assign a tag to a product, go to the product detail page by clicking on the product. Tags will then be located below the images section.

To create a new tag, click on the “Add Tags” box, type in your tag, and hit enter to save. If the item is a t-shirt, you might want to tag it with relevant keywords, like short sleeve, cotton, crewneck, etc. 

To delete a tag, click the gray “x” icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-deletetag.png "Reaction Commerce delete tag").)

To rearrange the order of a tag, click on the three horizontal lines icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-movetag.png "Reaction Commerce move tags")), and simply drag and drop.

### Hashtag URLs

The flag icon in each tag creates a product link based on that tag. Clicking on the flag generates a URL for your product containing just the words from that tag.

Eventually, hashtag URLs will allow you to glean important metrics regarding your products, like its social reach, how it compares to similar products, geolocation-based data, and much more. With this information, you’ll be able to better target your marketing efforts. 

## Navigation Tags

To edit the navigation tags of your shop, click on the “Add Tag” button in the top navigation bar of your shop.

To create a new navigation tag, type your keyword into the empty “Add Tag” box, and hit enter to save. Previously created tags may be auto suggested for you. Be sure your product tag corresponds with a navigation tag, otherwise your product page will be empty.

When you finish updating your navigation, click anywhere outside of the top nav bar to stop editing.
