# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your shop's central mainframe. It's where you manage your orders, add or remove products, install apps, and change your account settings. It's where the magic happens, more or less.

To access your Dashboard, simply click on the blue Reaction logo icon, located on the very top right of the page.
