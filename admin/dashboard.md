# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your online store's central mainframe. It's where you manage your orders, add or remove products, install apps, and change your account settings. It's where the magic happens, more or less.

To access your Dashboard, simply click on the blue Reaction logo icon, located on the very top right of the page.

Once you're in, you'll find a selection of nifty Dashboard features. To make configurations, simply click on the arrow icon, which will take you to a new page, or the cogwheel icon, which will pull up right sidebar options.
